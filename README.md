# anagramfinder

This is an anagram solver, which does the following:

1. Loads a dictionary from a file and converts each word into a list of characters. 
2. Takes in an input word.
3. Finds the different combination of letters in the word and checks whether they are in the dictionary.
4. The combinations of letters that are in the dictionary are returned as the anagrams of the input word.
